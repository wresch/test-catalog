Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) based on the Xfce desktop environment.

You can specify a data volume (`DataVolume`) to be mounted for data management. It will be mounted
at /data. In addition an optional home volume can be specified (`HomeVolume`) to serve as a
persistent home directory (e.g. `volume://user/persistent-4/username`).
